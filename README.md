# Telegram Zamin Channel Data Analysis

In Telegram, there is a channel called Zamin, where the admin of the channel announces all houses, apartments and lands are being sold or being put for rent in both Kabul and Mazar-e-sharif provinces of Afghanistan. These announcement happens one time or more than one time depending on the demands every day and are in persian language. Every announcement has little bit, but not complete and well-structured information about the sold and rented item.
